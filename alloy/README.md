Ship Home Assistant OS systemd journal logs to Grafana Loki **and host system metrics to
Prometheus** using Grafana Alloy.

Replaces the deprecated Promtail add-on which fails on HAOS 11+ due to systemd 252+ compact
journal format incompatibility, and adds node_exporter-style host monitoring (CPU, memory,
disk, network). Set `prometheus_url` to enable metrics; see the **Documentation** tab.

For full documentation, see the **Documentation** tab after installing.
